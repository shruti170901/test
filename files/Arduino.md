To put things as they are, **Arduino** is an open-source platform used for building electronics
projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a
**microcontroller**) and a piece of software, or **IDE** (Integrated Development Environment) that runs
on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.


Whoa, that was probably a lot of tech jargon thrown right at you. To ease things up a bit,
let’s start with something that you already know: **Biology**.


Our body perceives the world with its 5 sense organs- eyes, ears, skin, nose and tongue. We
gather information about our surroundings via these, receive and determine what sense to make
out of that information in our **Central Nervous System**, decide what reaction to give to that and
send the respective instructions to our muscles: Be it moving the hand, saying something or
blinking.


#### Sensory Receptors→Central Nervous System→Muscles


Now this is where lazy engineers step in. In this ‘*Era of Automation*’, they have been
trying to reduce human intervention in everyday tasks by creating machines that are ‘*smart*’,
machines that can ‘*sense*’ their surroundings and ‘*act*’ accordingly. So we copied our reflex
action mechanism, and made components that fit the puzzle. Presenting:


#### Sensors→Microcontroller→Actuators


Just remember these three words. You might be worried that you haven’t encountered the word
“Arduino” yet. Well, Arduino is just the name of a **microcontroller**, among many.


That’s one page. See you in the next one.
